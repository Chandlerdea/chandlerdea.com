			<h2>Freelance software engineer living in Santa Monica, California</h2>

			<p>
				Hello! My bread and butter is iOS development. I've worked on apps with tens of millions of users, and apps for small businesses generating millions in revenue. I've been writing Swift since it was released, and have a deep knowledge of Cococa Touch. I've worked on large legacy projects, slowly converted Objective-C codebases to Swift, and build apps in both Swift and Objective C from the ground up. I am also proficient in HTML and CSS, and I can hack Javascript.
			</p>

			<p>
				I am currently taking clients, and would love to help you with you iOS needs. <strong>Contact me</strong> to schedule a time to talk about your iOS needs.
