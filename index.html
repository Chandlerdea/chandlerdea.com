				<h2>Freelance software engineer</h2>
				<p>
					Hello! My name is Chandler De Angelis, and I have spent my whole career making iOS apps. I started learning how to code during college in 2011. I started with different programming books, reading a book about the C programming language, then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Objective-C-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321706285" class="big-nerd-ranch-book">Objective C</a>, and then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/iOS-Programming-Ranch-Guide-Guides/dp/0321773772" class="big-nerd-ranch-book">iOS development</a>. A downside of bypassing a computer science degree was that I was not taught some basic computer science concepts like Big O Notation, some of the more complex data structures, or different kinds of sorting algorithms. To make up for this, I took classes from <a href="https://www.harvard.edu/itunes" class="harvard-link">Harvard</a>, <a href="http://itunes.stanford.edu" id="stanford-link">Stanford</a>, and other Ivy League universities through Apple's iTunes U program. My favorite class was <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu" class="harvard-link">Harvard's CS50 course</a>, I highly recommend it for anyone who is thinking about learning programming. Don't worry, the instructor is amazing, and makes everything easy to understand.

					I've worked on apps with tens of millions of users, and apps for small businesses generating millions in revenue. I've been writing Swift since it was released, and have a deep knowledge of Cococa Touch. I've worked on large legacy projects, slowly converted Objective-C codebases to Swift, and build apps in both Swift and Objective C from the ground up. I am also proficient in HTML and CSS, and I can hack Javascript. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/Chandlerdea" id="github-link">Github</a> if you want to see some of my code, or see the source for this site (filing issues is totally welcome). You can also check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/chandlerdea/" id="linkedin-link">LinkedIn</a> for more information. I also have a <a href="https://medium.com/chandler-de-angelis">blog</a> that I post to occasinally.

					I am working as a Senior iOS Developer at <a href="http://www.mammoth.la">Mammoth Media</a>, so I am not taking freelance clients at the moment. But if you have any questions, or just want to say hello, <a href="contact.html" id="contact-link">contact me</a>.

								<h4>Fox Sports Go</h4>
								<p>
									Fox Sports Go is a video streaming application on iOS for both iPhone and iPad, and is a major revenue source for Fox Sports. I worked on a team of 4 iOS developers, and helped implement new designs, as well as improve the efficiency of video streaming.

								<h4>Fox Sports Mobile</h4>
								<p>
									I built the first version of the application from the ground up. I worked with other developers on architecture, in both design and implementation. The original app was called Bigboard, and has since been renamed to Fox Sports Mobile, and been enhanced with more features. The version we build was limited to selecting teams who you wanted to follow, and displaying games for all of the different sports, and the design and implementation has been largley unchanged. I also wrote code that was added to one of our public facing frameworks.

								<h4>Flipagram</h4>
								<p>
									During my time at Flipagram, we had 32 million MAUs. We had teams responsible for different verticles in our business, and I was on the creation team. This meant that I was responcible for the whole creation flow of the app. I built the initial implementation of the camera feature alonside one other iOS dev, using AVFoundation. I also created the ability for users to import music from iTunes, or the music library, into the Flipagram they were creating.

								<h4>Spinlister Pro</h4>
								<p>
									Spinlister Pro is a consumer facing iPad app for bike shops. The app took our company's monthly revenue from less than $1,000/month, to over $1,000,000/month, by giving bike shops a fast, modern way for customers to rent from their inventory. For most of my time at Spinlister, I was the only iOS developer, so I built the app on my own. The app gave customers the ability to view and rent bikes from bike shops, with a easy to use interface.

								<h4>Yarn</h4>
								<p>
									I played an integral role in the development of Yarn 5.0. I was responsible for building out the 'backend' of the app, which included networking, the data model, and caching, as well as setting up CI. We focused on building reusable components that could be used across applications, using the BUCK build system.

					These aren't the only apps I've worked on. Some are not available on the app store, and others were on the app store at one time, but have been taken down. If would like to know about these projects, <a href="contact.html" id="contact-link">contact me</a>.
