				<p>
					At Spinlister, I was the lead iOS developer. Learn more about how I helped take Spinlister's revenue from less than $1000/month to over $1,000,000/month.

				<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flipagram/id512727332?mt=8">Flipagram</a></h3>

				<p>
					I worked on a larger team of 5 iOS developers at Flipagram, on an app with tens of millions of daily active users. We mostly focused on building new features, and writing both unit tests and integration tests for those features. We adopted Swift early on, and I had the most experience using Swift, so I helped my co workers get comfortable with Swift as it evolved. My largest contribution was building the initial camera feature, alongside one of the founders.

				<h3><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fox-sports-mobile/id294056623?mt=8">Fox Sports</a></h3>

				<p>
					At Fox Sports, I work on a small mobile team of 2 iOS developers (including me), and two Android developers. Because of our small size, I am working on multiple projects at once, sometimes building products from the ground up, on my own. I even wrote code that was used as an example for implementing logic in one the third party libraries used in one of our apps. We implement Agile development, so I sometimes work on exploratory prototypes, or throw away projects to test new APIs. Despite our size, we are fast, and are building new products faster than our QA team can handle.
