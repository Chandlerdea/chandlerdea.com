			<p>
				 HIIT Trainer never collects your personal information. If you give permission, I receive crash logs from your device, which enables me to fix crashes and make your experience beter. The app uses HealthKit, but only if you give permission. The app gathers your movement activity, heart rate, and other vital data, and has access to your body measurements. We take the data received from your workout, and send it to HealhKit, so you can track your workout history in the Health app. I don't have any servers storing information, all the data stays on your device.
